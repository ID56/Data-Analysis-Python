# Data-Analysis-Python
Before working on any particular machine learning problem, it is a reasonably decent idea to explore the given data first. Here's some of the exploratory data analysis I usually use.

Libraries used: Numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib.

Data: The Ames Housing Dataset, from kaggle. Original source: http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock/AmesHousing.xls
